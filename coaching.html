    <h1>Executive Coaching</h1>
    <p>My coaching practice grew directly from my consulting practice. I have no formal training as a "coach." This role has emerged as clients have come to see me as a trusted advisor.</p>

<p>From time to time, clients who have engaged me to focus on their strategies have also been facing management issues and valued having an experienced manager with an independent perspective to use as a "sounding board." I do not apply an published or prescriptive approach.</p>

<p>In some cases, clients who have provided references regarding my work, have mentioned that they value the few hours of advisory time even more than the many hours of helpful strategic planning.</p><br/>
<p>These situations have included:</p>
<p><span class="uline">Internal tension among key staff:</span><br/>
On more than one occasion, executive directors of nonprofits have had two valuable senior staff that did not work well together; and the client engaged me as a coach and facilitator. While I have no formal training as a coach or therapist, I handle these situations with the same pragmatic approach that I would have used when I was managing a large organization.</p>
<p><span class="uline">Tension between the executive director and the Board:</span><br/>
I am proud that on two occasions I have been asked for advice in these situations and in both cases the organization has thrived without a change in executive director. In both instances, style and trust issues were the root causes, not performance. Interestingly, in one case the board asked for my help and in the other, the executive director sought my counsel.</p>
<p><span class="uline">Performance issues:</span><br/>
From time to time, I have been asked to help advise when there is a performance issue within the senior staff.  Often the executive director needs a sounding board about the feedback process and their ultimate decision to retain or terminate the employee. In all termination cases, legal counsel, experienced in local labor law have advised on the specifics.</p>
<p><span class="uline">Major business decisions:</span><br/>
Expansion, contraction, gift acceptance and succession planning are a few examples of major decisions my clients have faced. In all these areas, I was able to draw on my experience with other clients and my own management background. Again, the terms "sounding board" and "wise counsel" have been used to describe the role I was able to provide.</p>
